Scannerator is an app designed to simplify management of individual devices enrolled in Jamf Pro. Devices can be searched for using the search bar, or on iOS devices barcodes or qr codes can be scanned to auto-fill the search bar. Only minimal information and actions are currently available, but each devices' entry's device name can be clicked to open the record directly in Jamf Pro.

## Getting Started
Once the project has been cloned to your machine navigate to the Scannerator project > Signing and Capabilities > Choose a team with a signing certificate. The team doesn't matter, it just needs a certificate to create the local build.
